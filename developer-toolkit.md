# Developer toolkit

The following tools will help you as a developer regardless of what branch or language you specialize in.

## shell

Two main benefits to improving your command line skills: you can focus on the actual command rather than the syntax of it (npm, git, etc) and improved speed when performing common operations (that could also be done with the GUI... but slower).

## git

Version control is necessary, in order to keep track of all changes and older versions of source code files, and to facilitate collaboration.

## linters and style guides

Consistency in the codebase is key, especially when working with other developers. We can use linters -extensions for a code editor that analyze the code to point at potential errors- combined with style guides to ensure respect of good practices, and a consistent style accross a project.

## debug with VSCode

Debugging with print statements will only work to a certain extent, and while it may still remain one of your go-to when hunting for the source of dysfunctioning code, there are other options that will come in handy, especially when working with more complex projects, e.g when the steps to trigger a bug are tedious to reproduce.
