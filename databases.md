# Databases

MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch are amongst the top databases (most popular) according to [StackOverflow's 2019 Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-databases).  

## Redis

Redis is an in-memory store that supports strings (key / value), hashes (or maps, collections of key / value pairs), lists, sets etc.  
It is really fast and [pretty easy to learn](https://www.openmymind.net/2011/11/8/Redis-Zero-To-Master-In-30-Minutes-Part-1/).  
Like MongoDB it is also non relational, but by nature, the database's size is limited to the amount of available memory (RAM).

## PostgreSQL

As opposed to MongoDB, which is a Document Database, PostgreSQL is an Object Relational Database that uses a variant of SQL as the query language. As a relational databases, it performs well when it comes to storing information that relates to one another.

## Graph databases

Another type of databases that performs really well when relationships between entities become more complex (and contain precious information) is the graph.
